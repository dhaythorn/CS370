# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  In this project I had to use reinforcement learning to guide an actor through a maze.
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    Computer scientists study computation and what can be computed and/or what is a computational problem. 
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    I first figure out the project I am trying to solve. Then I go about learning how it is commonly solved in that space. Once I've figured that out I would put together a software stack that solved my problem.
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    Privacy and safety are my responsibilites, especially if AI is involved.
